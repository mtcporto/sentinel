# **App Name**: Sentinel AI

## Core Features:

- Intelligent Log Analysis: Leverage AI to analyze system logs, identify anomalies, and provide insights into potential issues using an LLM tool.
- System Dashboard: Present a real-time dashboard with key system metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage, service status) visualized for easy monitoring.
- AI-Powered Diagnostics: Enable users to request an AI-driven diagnosis of the system based on current logs and status, with suggested actions for resolution. This involves the use of an LLM tool to reason about the logs.
- Secure Command Execution: Securely execute administrative commands (restart services, manage firewall rules, etc.) with user approval, while maintaining a detailed audit log.
- Action History: Maintain a comprehensive history of all actions performed, providing a record of system interventions for auditing and troubleshooting.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep, calming blue (#3F51B5) to inspire trust and stability, as this app deals with system security.
- Background color: A very dark, desaturated blue-gray (#22272E) provides excellent contrast to text, as this app uses a dark color scheme for comfortable late-night operation.
- Accent color: Use a vibrant violet (#9C27B0) for highlighting critical alerts and interactive elements.
- Use a clear, monospaced font for log displays, where it is important to clearly distinguish the characters from one another.
- Design a modular layout for the dashboard, allowing users to customize and prioritize key metrics. Consider widgets and drag-and-drop functionality.
- Subtle animations for loading indicators and status changes will show activity, so the user does not think the application is stuck or non-responsive.
